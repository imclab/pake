pake
====

A simple implementation of make in pure Python with no external
dependencies

Why use pake?
-------------

-  pake allows you to replace your Makefiles with a single
   platform-independent build script with no external dependencies
   except Python. You can use the same build script on Linux, Mac OS X,
   Windows, and more.

-  pake is contained in a single, short Python file which is trivially
   easy to distribute: just copy it into your project.

-  pake is a generic build tool, just like make, it can be used for
   building projects written in any language.

-  pake's declarative pure-Python DSL will be instantly familiar to
   developers familiar with make.

-  pake uses timestamps to determine when to rebuild targets, just like
   make.

-  pake is fast. As many tasks can be accomplished in pure Python,
   without spawning a subprocess, pake is faster than make.

-  pake supports normal targets, virtual targets, variables, and rules.

-  pake automatically creates 'clean' targets for you, just pass the
   ``-c`` option.

-  pake exposes its underlying data model so you can easily script it
   for custom build logic.

Example
-------

This example demonstrates most of pake's features. You can find it in
the ``example`` directory where you can run it with the command
``./build.py``. To clean up, run ``./build -c``.

::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import pake

    # Variables can be overridden on the command line or with environment
    # variables.
    pake.variables.CC = 'gcc'

    # Normal Python constants can be used
    SRC = 'hello.c'

    # Virtual targets are like make's .PHONY targets.
    pake.virtual('all', 'hello')

    # Normal targets consist of the target followed by a list of dependencies,
    # the decorated function is the action to build the target.
    @pake.target('hello', 'hello.o')
    def hello(t):
        t.run('%(CC)s', '-o', t.name, t.dependencies)

    # Rules match on regular expressions and return a target.  The decorated
    # function receives the target name and the regexp match result and returns a
    # new target.
    @pake.rule(r'(?P<filename>.*)\.o\Z')
    def o(name, match):
        def action(t):
            t.run('%(CC)s', '-c', '-o', t.name, t.dependencies)
        dependencies = '%(filename)s.c' % match.groupdict()
        return pake.Target(name, action=action, dependencies=dependencies)       

    # Don't forget to call main()!
    pake.main()
